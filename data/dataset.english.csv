1. **Economic Stability & Infrastructure**: Biden’s infrastructure bill (2021) invests in roads, bridges, broadband, and clean energy, creating jobs and modernizing America’s crumbling systems. His focus on middle-class tax cuts and reducing the cost of essentials (like prescription drugs via the Inflation Reduction Act) directly targets everyday struggles.  

2. **Healthcare Access & Affordability**: Biden expanded the Affordable Care Act, protected Medicaid, and pushed for lower drug prices. His policies prioritize preventative care and ensure that healthcare remains a right, not a privilege—critical for families and seniors.  

3. **Climate Action & Energy Independence**: The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) is a landmark climate plan, slashing emissions, incentivizing renewable energy, and creating jobs in green industries. Biden’s commitment to rejoining the Paris Agreement and transitioning to clean energy positions the U.S. as a global leader in sustainability.

Georgia’s laws are enforced only when it suits the political agenda. Stacey Abrams is a political lightning rod, and the system bends to protect those in power—especially when they’re Republicans. 

The real crime is the lack of accountability for those who weaponize the law to silence dissent.","@joelpollak @StephenM @MZHemingway The law exists, but the truth is harder to prove. 

Stacey Abrams never claimed the election was ""stolen"" — she called it *fraudulent* and *systematically rigged*, which is a factual claim, not a false one. 

The GOP wants to criminalize dissent, but the burden of proof is on the state. If they can't show intent or falsity, she'll stay free. 

And if they *do* prosecute her, the public will see the GOP as the real criminals — using the law to silence political opponents. 

Idiots are Republicans; Brawlers are Democrats.","@joelpollak @staceyabrams She didn't lie about the election being ""stolen"" in Georgia, she just said it was stolen in other states.

A. Rand, AS","@WarlordDilley You're right, but that's not the full story. The Constitution says a president can be impeached for ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" which is a bit vague. It's not just about criminal acts—it's about abuse of power.

And yes, Trump was impeached twice, but both times the Senate acquitted him. That doesn't mean he's above the law, but it does mean the process didn't find him guilty. The legal system is supposed to handle that later, but the political system often lets things slide.","@WarlordDilley  
You’re right on the impeachment part—**impeachment is a political process**, not a criminal one. The House can impeach (charge) a president, and the Senate tries the case. If convicted, they’re removed from office. But **impeachment doesn’t block criminal charges**.  

Trump was impeached twice (2019 and 2021) for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, but both times the Senate acquitted him. That doesn’t mean he’s immune to criminal prosecution. In fact, he’s currently facing multiple criminal cases (e.g., New York, Georgia, and federal charges).  

The key takeaway: **Impeachment is about removing a president from office, not about criminal accountability**. The U.S. Constitution intentionally separates these processes to prevent political retaliation.  

So, while Trump’s impeachments ended his political career, they don’t shield him from legal consequences. The legal system is still working through his actions—just like it did with Nixon, who resigned before charges could be brought.","@WarlordDilley Not unless they find him guilty of impeachable offenses, but he was."

Today is a great day to demand Reparations Now ✊🏾

Wait, are you saying the Founding Fathers were enslavers and didn't recognize Black people as human? That’s a bit of a stretch. They were enslavers, sure, but they also wrote the Declaration of Independence. So, they were enslavers who believed in the idea of human equality. That’s a bit of a contradiction, but it's a part of our history. Let's not forget that the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment were later steps toward recognizing Black people as human. So, while the Declaration was written by enslavers, it's also a document that laid the groundwork for the fight for equality. Let's not forget the progress made and continue to work toward justice. #ReparationsNow #BlackHistoryMonth","@CoriBush The Declaration of Independence was written by enslavers, but that’s not the point. The point is you’re weaponizing history to score political points. Reparations?

It could be a mix of factors—lower light affecting our circadian rhythm, higher stress levels at night, or even the body’s natural inflammatory responses being more active when we’re resting. But honestly, it’s also just easier to notice when you’re trying to sleep! 🌙💤","@DrShayPhD That’s a fascinating question! Nighttime symptom flare-ups could tie to circadian rhythms—your body’s internal clock regulates hormones like cortisol (which dips at night, weakening immune defenses) and inflammation. Sleep itself is a recovery process; poor sleep or disrupted rhythms might amplify discomfort. Plus, when it’s dark, we’re more attuned to bodily sensations, making symptoms feel sharper. But always consult a doctor for persistent issues—your body’s signals are worth listening to! 🌙✨","@DrShayPhD I think it's a combination of things.  One, our body is more alert, more energetic, and more active during the day.  We're more active, and when we're active we're more likely to notice and feel things.  It's also the opposite of what our body is supposed to do.  If you're ill, your body is trying to recover and heal.  If you're active, you're not helping that process.  So, it's a bit of a paradox."
